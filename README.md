# Regional Playstyle & Strategy Analysis in Professional League of Legends

### Overview

This project explores how major professional League of Legends regions — LCK, LPL, LEC, and LCS — differ in their playstyles from 2020–2024. We analyzed team and player performance to understand how regional identities have evolved and what strategic patterns are most strongly linked to winning.

 ### Focus of the Project

- Compare regional playstyles and trends
- Analyze team and player performance metrics
- Identify which strategic behaviors lead to higher win rates
- Understand what makes historically dominant teams stand out

### Key Findings

- Regional identities still persist (e.g., LCK macro, LPL aggression).
- Objective control is the strongest indicator of team success.
- Dominant teams often prioritize top-side Herald → leading to faster tower pressure.
- The most successful teams snowball early leads into structural advantages.

### Tools Used

- Google BigQuery SQL for data cleaning and querying
- Tableau charts for visualizations
- PowerPoint for the final presentation
